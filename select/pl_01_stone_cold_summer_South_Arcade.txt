I wanna be on my own planet
Where I don't run into you
And you don't run into me
Just "getting by" life
I can't stand it
Everybody taking it too seriously
Get lost at sea
Know what I mean
So don't come looking for me
But if she's small town heavy
She might not be ready
On this stone cold summer night
But if you just let me
Steal you from the city
Of your store bought paradise
Then we might be alright
And now i'm watching on the outside
(On the outside)
It's like your running race
That no one actually wins
No one actually wins
Your out of place and I'm like so what
So what
Don't have to sink if you can't swim
Get lost at sea
Know what I mean
So don't come looking for me
But if she's small town heavy
She might not be ready
On this stone cold summer night
But if you just let me
Steal you from the city
Of your store bought paradise
Then we might be alright
And we might be alright
And we might be alright
And we might be alright
Let go, you should let go
Won't you let go
You should let, let, let, let
Let go, you could let go
You could let go
You could let, let, let, let
But if she's small town heavy
She might not be ready
On this stone cold summer night
But if you just let me
Steal you from the city
Of your store bought paradise
Then we might be alright
